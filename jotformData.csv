This retaining wall however allowed the middle floors of the building to be effectively at ground level of the new garden on the slope. This made the upper building accessible and possible since 3 storey kindergartens are not common in this country, it aided the fire exit strategy and plan that was closely worked with the authority.

Name Material: Oak floor, Name Supplier: Local, Select all applicable material categories: Biodegradable
Circular
Local, Describe where the material is used: The oak is used on the face of new timber stairs. There was a strategy to use timber raised and insulated floors at all points so that the floor would have slight resilience and give to children (falling) and the use of cork layers and natural Lino. On the stairs the oak was a similar less hard material than concrete and it allowed the contrast change in the noising required to be done in an oak stain - this avoided hard or metal edges, a practical consideration. But throughout the building the finishes aim to be non institutional. Pendant lights, bronzed handles, oak, Lino, painted dado rails, all were aligned with a 'big house', or the old houses some children live in still in the area, not a school., Estimate what % of the project is built with this material: 1%
